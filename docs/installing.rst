Installing and configuring
==========================

Installing spaghetti
--------------------

1. Install some spaghetti::

    pip install django-spaghetti-and-meatballs

2. Add ``"django_spaghetti"`` to your ``INSTALLED_APPS`` setting like this::

    INSTALLED_APPS = [
      ...
      'django_spaghetti',
    ]

3. Add a plate of spaghetti in your ``urls.py`` like so::

    from django.urls import path
  
    urlpatterns += patterns('',
      path(r'^plate/', include('django_spaghetti.urls')),
    )

4. Or use the class-based view if you want more flexibility::

    urlpatterns += patterns('',
      path(r'^plate/$',
        Plate.as_view(
          override_settings = {
              'apps':['auth','polls'],
            }
        ),
        name='plate'
      ),
    )


Configuring meatballs
---------------------

``django-spaghetti-and-meatballs`` takes a few options set in the ``SPAGHETTI_SAUCE``
variable from your projects ``settings.py`` file that make it `extra spicy`::

  SPAGHETTI_SAUCE = {
    'apps':['auth','polls'],
    'show_fields':False,
    'exclude':{'auth':['user']},
    'show_proxy':True,
    'show_m2m_field_detail':False
  }

In the above dictionary, the following settings are used:

* ``apps`` is a list of apps you want to show in the graph. If its `not` in here it `won't be seen`.
* ``show_fields`` is a boolean that states if the field names should be shown in the graph or just in the hover-over text. For small graphs, you can set this to `True` to show fields as well, but as you get more models it gets messier.
* ``exclude`` is a dictionary where each key is an ``app_label`` and the items for that key are model names to hide in the graph.
* ``show_proxy`` is boolean, if truthy proxy models will be shown and linked to their main model, otherwise they will be hidden. By default this is false.
* ``show_m2m_field_detail`` is boolean, if truthy ``ManyToManyField``s will be shown with their documentation in the detailed content for a model. By default this is false.

If its not working as expected make sure your app labels and model names are all **lower case**.
